OpenZT2 — Trailer Script

[FADE IN: Black screen. Nostalgic Zoo Tycoon 2 menu music, slightly distorted.]

"You remember."

[Quick cuts: pixelated lions, blocky exhibits, guests complaining about paths.]

"The penguins escaping. The hours lost. The mods that broke every update."

[Music cuts. Silence.]

[Text on black: "2004 - 2025"]

"Twenty years. Still no Linux support. Still 800x600. Still crashes on Windows
11."

[Beat.]

[Text fades in: "What if we fixed that?"]

[New music: ambient, building. Code scrolling on screen.]

"Open source. Cross-platform. Mod-friendly by design."

[Quick cuts: 4K render of a zoo, Lua scripts running, Steam Deck gameplay.]

"Your old saves. Your old mods. Your new hardware."

[Logo reveal: OpenZT2]

"The zoo you built. The engine you deserved."

[Text: "github.com/openzt2 — Join the herd."]

[FADE OUT]
